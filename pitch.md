Time Efficiency

Our current education system leading to our career path is a sequence where a body of knowledge has to be completed to move onto the next level. This is inefficient because it allows for slack; if the first level of science can be completed before the first level of history for a given student, that student should do so and move onto level 2 science instead of learning level 1 at a slower pace. Maximize efficiency.

Decentralising Education (but not really)

Government established learning facilities is our current norm. 

Visualised Data

Visual representation of a person’s interest can shed some light on what he/she would like to pursue as a career. 

Machine Learning

We can also use machine learning to predict job market trends to inform our society on what kind of jobs will be needed and which will be in surplus. For example, if a large number of students have been excelling in math but failing in social studies, the probability of more future engineers increase whereas we may have less politicians. Providing this kind of information can sway interest and balance out the job market. 

Evolution: What’s to come

Once you have chosen on a specialisation (or specialisations), you now have the ability to create and manage your own education tree. For example, as an engineer, we will build our
